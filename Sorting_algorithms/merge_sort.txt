Problem statement
You are given the starting 'l' and the ending 'r' positions of the array 'ARR'.



You must sort the elements between 'l' and 'r'.



Note:
Change in the input array itself. So no need to return or print anything.
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 7,
'ARR' = [2, 13, 4, 1, 3, 6, 28]

Output: [1 2 3 4 6 13 28]

Explanation: After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [1 2 3 4 6 13 28].
