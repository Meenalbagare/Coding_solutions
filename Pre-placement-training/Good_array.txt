subject Codingcasino 100 points
DESCRIPTION
Problem Statement

An array a of n elements containing only unique values is considered good if exactly n-1 numbers are satisfying the below condition:

For every number x in a, there should be a number y in a such that y is just greater than x and y % x = 0.
Input Format

The first line is an integer n.
Next n lines of input will be the a[i] (0 <= i < n)
Constraints

(2 <= n <= 1e5)
(1<= a[i] <= 1e9) and all values are unique.
Output Format

print "Yes" if the array is good; else, print "No".
Evaluation Parameters

Sample Input
5
3 
12 
120 
24 
1
Sample Output
Yes
Explanation
The n-1 numbers can be chosen as 1, 3, 12, 24

the number just greater than 1 is 3, and 3 is divisible by 1.

the number just greater than 3 is 3, and 12 is divisible by 3.

the number just greater than 12 is 24, and 24 is divisible by 12.

the number just greater than 24 is 120, and 120 is divisible by 24.
