subject Codingcasino 100 points
DESCRIPTION
Problem Statement

You are given an integer array, a[], of size n, and an integer k. You are asked to make every number of a[] the multiple of k by adding zero or some positive value to each number.

What are the minimum numbers you require to make all the numbers of the array multiple of k?

Input Format

The first line of input will be n, the size of the array.
Next, n lines will be the element of the array.
The next line will be an integer k, to which every number should be multiple.
Constraints

(1 <= n <= 1e5)
(1 <= a[i] , k <= 1e9)
Output Format

Output the minimum numbers you need to add to the array elements, such that every element is multiple of k.
Evaluation Parameters

Sample Input
5
14
25
4
6
18
3
Sample Output
5
Explanation
In this example, every number should be multiple of 3:

we have to add 1 number to 14 as 15 is divisible by 3.

we have to add 2 numbers to 25 as 27 is divisible by 3.

we have to add 2 numbers to 4 as 6 is divisible by 3.

we have to add 0 number to 6 as 6 is divisible by 3.

We have to add 0 to 18 as 18 is divisible by 3.
